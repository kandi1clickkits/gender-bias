# What should I know before I get started?

## What is Reading for Gender Bias?

Implicit gender bias in evaluations negatively impacts women at every stage of her career. The goal of this project is to create a web-based text analysis tool that scans and reveals language bias associated with evaluations and letters of recommendation written for trainees and applicants. The tool will provide a summary of potential changes to the writer to help them remove bias. The hope is that by bringing awareness to the existence of implicit bias, we can change how evaluations for women are drafted and judged, thereby providing a concrete way to tackle gender disparities.

# How can I explore the current code?

## Running

To run the current code:
* Ensure you have a python installation on your system
* Obtain a copy of the repository
* Set up a python virtual environment for the project (optional but recommended)
* Go to the project directory and run `pip install .`

## Setting up for development

To install the project so that changes are reflected in the installed script and library, run `pip install -e .`.


## Using the test suite

For your reference, the entire automated test suite can be found in the `tests` directory.

Installation:
* In order to use the test suite, you must have the python packages `pytest` and `pylint` installed on your machine.
* To install these, run `pip install -e .[dev]`.
* Or, to install them individually, run `pip install pytest` and `pip install pylint`.

To test all of the detectors at once, execute `./run_tests.sh`. This script calls `pytest` and `pylint`.

To run an individual detector test, run (for example) `pytest tests/test_publication_detector.py`.


# How can I contribute?

## Your first contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to Reading for Gender Bias? You can start by looking at `good first issue` and `help wanted` issues.

We are using python for our programming language.  There is a folder of letters for testing code [here](https://github.com/molliem/gender-bias/tree/master/example_letters).

You can also take a look at the [Roadmap](https://github.com/molliem/gender-bias/issues/1) to get a sense of where we are going and to start making your own milestones and issues. 

Please reach out if you have questions.  I am new to programming, but will try to answer your questions as completely and quickly as I can.  I am also in class, so if you don't immediately hear from me, it's not you, it is definitely me.
